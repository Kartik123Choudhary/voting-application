// Voting application requirements :

1. User should be able to Sign in or Sign Up
2. A functionality where the candidates can give the votes to the parties:
3. We can see the list of the candidates
4. one person can vote only one time
5. user should be able to see the counting of the votes ( basically the user can see which party is leading and how many votes are given to that party)
6. user data must contain their one unique government id proof named : aadhar card ( means for giving the vote the user must be Indian and he should be having his aadhar card which will basically show that
he is eligible to vote and he is Indian citizen , along with that he should also use username and password).
7. there should an admin which will handle everything like the table of candidate and he can perform any CRUD operations on the database for the candidates and he cant vote at all.
8. user can change their password.
9. We have also included the SMS And email functionality in our code, that whenever we tried to login,
we will get a notification and an email.
10. this program also includes tokens ( JWT token concept ) and there will also be a option for the logout.
